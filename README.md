## Dashboard creation

Excel is indeed a powerful tool that doesnâ€™t require core coding (until you are not getting into VBAs). This means that any business or nontechnical individual can gather insights from data using Excel. A dashboard is a consolidated view of visual elements that convey knowledge about the dataset. It supports data validation in the form of filters and sorting methods.
